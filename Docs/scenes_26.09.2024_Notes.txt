Incubatio Scenes Notes

1: Video: Fractal or Avatar in Sphere
Possible Avatar Preset 402 or Fractal Preset 315

2: Gaiska drawing in the back with horizontal laser
3. Gaiska opens door with laser
4: Gaiska draws the silouette of Arnaud with laser
5: Arnaud turns and enters in the middle (intrance of Arnaud)
6: Gaiska and Arnaud move slowly around table
7: gaiska and Arnaud split and face each other across the table
8: Arnaud lies down on the table
9: Gaiska creates the temple with the vertical laser
TODO: mocap recording of the temple creation
10: Gaiska enters the table, stands on table, and paints Arnoud silouette with vertical laser
11: Gaiska does Spatial Recovery (back left, back right, front right, middle left)

12: 1 When Gaiska at front right and extends arm, Arm video appears on transparent screen (for about 20 seconds), arm contorts alongside the arm of Gaiska (maybe tracking) 

Video: arm1 simulation

raymarching scene controls arm1
Raymarching Preset: 1600
First video on the big screen
Simulation Physics Preset: 140
Simulation Fluidity Preset: 1 

Raymarching  Scene Rotation X from 0.0 to 180.0: what is the cue for this?

When video moves under the table, Gaiska continues his tour around the table
Then video under the table:
Switch to searching behaviour
Simulation Physics Preset: 100
Simulation Particles Preset: 1 

When Gaiska is at the center back of the table, the arm disappears.



13: Gaiska middle back at the table and stretched his head towards the screen, Mercurio Variation 1 stands (this about 2 minutes after the arm appeared), maybe 1 minute mercurio alone, then 10 seconds mercurio with Gaiska visible, then only mercurio 10 seconds, then only Gaiska

Video: Mercurio

Center section of Mercurio appears under table when Gaiska does Mudra
When Gaiska silently screams to the screen, Mercurio appears big on screen

14: Gaiska comes to front of table faces screen, holds heands on head: Mercurio with brain appears (50 seconds)

transition mercurio to brain
TODO: have a brain version in which more of the original Mercurio is visible (i.e. Fractal is a bit behind Mercurio)
after a while (cue unclear), Pedro shrinks Brain down, which is the cue for Gaiska to finish his variation
somewhen (cue unclear), Pedro fades out the brain

15: Gasika finishes variation and manipulated Arnaud who lies on table, Arnaud Sonification starts
16: Gaiska is painting with light on Arnaud (and maybe also Light Forest) 

Swarm Painting with Light
Start only swarm simulation
The Light is controlled by Pedro and Pablo
go through same stages as in Embodied Machine: Scanning, Wiggling
But then detach swarm from mocap joint and have it come to center of table

17: Four Arms appear on large screen, the four arms manipulate Arnaud

Arms4 Preset: 701
Arms should be pointing down

18: Gaiska makes three motions towards the mouth of Arnaud: trops of light appear underneath the table (the rain version of the lights) (maybe )

Video and Swarm: Drops of Light
use special raymarching max patch: scene drops of light
after a while (cue?) transition from raining drops to central elongated shape still under the table
TODO: have a more sideways view on the drops of light

19: Gaiska stands on the table and taps on his body, droplets of light move to the large transparent screen


move video from under the table to big screen
later (cue) transition into vertical golden shape with drops circling

Drops of Light Circular Blob Preset: 4 or  313 or 319 (with swarm preset 4)

impro: joint smoothing, swarm evasion

drops of light disappear (cue?)


20: Gaiska stops moving and then slowly lowers himself to the belly of Arnaud 
Arnaud pushes his belly out four times, first three small pushes, then large push

Afterwards, magnetic water appears below table
water goes through sequence: from small ripples, to larger ripples, to shape bulging out
then the video goes to big screen
the pushed out shape stays for a while
then the wiggling starts
since the wiggling progresses very slowy, start rotation before wiggling reaches end
TODO: make sure there is no jump in the whiggling when rotation starts

21: Gaiska moves snakelike and Arnaud staccato: Snake appears under table 

Video: Switch to Snake Raymarching

22: Gaiska and Arnaud standing on table, Pas de deux, lots of movement: Laser swarm appears, same swarm as in Embodied Machine

Laser Swarm visualised in Touch Designer

23: Gaiska and Arnaud getting slower, Arnaud lies down, Gaiska goes down from table: laser swarm focuses into single line through Arnaud's heart.

24: Gaiska puts cables on his heart, the Heart appears underneath the table, first as line only, then growing into heart (still underneath table)

when the line looks like a beanstalk, move to big screen
then continue transformation into heart



controls_heart2lava.maxpat


25: Arnaud makes heart movements, heart moves to the large screen
26: Heart morphs (cue) into Lava Fractal, Fractal becomes very large
